Iteration 1 — Representing the Game Area

Goal: Display a 10×20 grid and verify empty state.

Tasks:
Write a test: gameboard initializes with empty cells

Implement minimal Board class

Render empty grid on screen

AI prompts to practice:

“Write a test for an empty gameboard.”
“Implement only what is needed to pass the test.”

Iteration 2 — A Single Falling Block (1×1)

Goal: Spawn a block and let it fall one step per tick.

Tasks:

Test: spawning a block places it at the top

Test: block moves down on tick()

Implement falling logic

Render falling square

AI prompts:

“Add only the code required to make this block fall.”
“Refactor the update loop so movement is separate from rendering.”

Iteration 3 — Stacking Behavior

Goal: Block stops when reaching bottom or another block.

Tasks:

Test: block stops at bottom

Test: new block spawns after first block stops

Add collision detection

Visual stacking

Iteration 4 — Player Input (Left/Right/Drop)

Goal: Move block horizontally.

Tasks:

Tests:

block moves right if space is free

block does not move outside board

Implement arrow key handling

Add "hard drop" (space): instantly move to lowest available row

AI prompts:

“Write safety tests to avoid index errors on boundaries.”

Iteration 5 — Shapes Instead of 1×1 Blocks

Goal: Introduce classic tetrominoes (L, I, T, O, S, Z, J).

Tasks:

Test: spawnRandomPiece returns a valid shape

Represent pieces as arrays of coordinates

Render composite shape falling

Iteration 6 — Rotation

Goal: Press ↑ to rotate the piece.

Tasks:

Test: piece rotates within bounds

Handle basic rotations (90° clockwise)

Block rotation when colliding with walls or other blocks

Iteration 7 — Line Clearing

Goal: Detect and clear full horizontal rows.

Tasks:

Test: clears filled row and moves above rows down

Implement row detection

Implement collapse of rows

Add visual feedback

Optional Advanced (if time allows)
Iteration 8 — Game Over

Test: game ends when new piece overlaps existing blocks

Implement overlay message

Iteration 9 — Score + Level

Score increases with lines cleared

Level affects falling speed
