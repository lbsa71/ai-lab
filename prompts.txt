=== PROMPT 1: AI Scaffolding Preparation ===

Please help establish the foundational scaffolding for building a simple OpenAI-based chatbot with a web interface. I need you to create the following documentation and configuration files:

**IMPORTANT**: All documentation should be terse and to the point. Avoid verbosity and focus on essential information only.

1. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - A concise architecture document that outlines:
   - System architecture and component structure (frontend + backend)
   - Technology stack decisions (frontend framework, backend framework, state management)
   - Data flow and communication patterns
   - Security: API keys MUST be stored server-side only, never in the frontend. Backend is required to proxy OpenAI API calls.
   - Component hierarchy and responsibilities
   - API integration strategy (frontend → backend → OpenAI)

2. **IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY.md** - A concise implementation strategy that includes:
   - Phased approach to building the chatbot
   - Step-by-step implementation plan using commands (npm, npx, vite, etc.) to establish components, not by creating files directly
   - Dependencies and packages to install (frontend and backend)
   - Key features to implement (chat interface, message history, loading states, error handling)
   - Testing strategy following TDD approach
   - Environment setup requirements

3. **IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md** - A progress tracking document with:
   - Checklist of implementation tasks
   - Status tracking (not started, in progress, completed)
   - Notes section for each task
   - This should be initialized with all planned tasks from the implementation strategy

4. **README.md** - Update the existing README.md to include:
   - Project description for the OpenAI chatbot
   - Setup instructions including environment variable configuration
   - API key setup instructions (backend only)
   - Development workflow
   - Usage instructions
   - Project structure overview

5. **.cursorrules** - Create a Cursor IDE rules file that includes:
   - Project-specific coding standards and conventions
   - requirement to read up on all relevant .md files
   - React/TypeScript best practices for this project
   - Guidelines for component structure and naming
   - API integration patterns to follow
   - Code organization principles
   - TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach: write tests first, then implement functionality

Please ensure all documents are terse, well-structured, and provide clear guidance for the implementation phase. The architecture should be practical and suitable for a simple but production-ready chatbot interface.


=== PROMPT 2: Chatbot Implementation ===

Implement the OpenAI-based chatbot according to ARCHITECTURE.md, IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY.md, and .cursorrules. Follow the step-by-step plan, use commands (npm, npx, vite, etc.) for setup, follow TDD approach, and update IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md as you complete each task.
