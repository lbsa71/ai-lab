=== PROMPT 1: AI Scaffolding Preparation ===

Please help establish the foundational scaffolding for building a simple OpenAI-based chatbot with a web interface. I need you to create the following documentation and configuration files:

**IMPORTANT**: All documentation should be terse and to the point. Avoid verbosity and focus on essential information only.

1. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - A concise architecture document that outlines:
   - System architecture and component structure (frontend + backend)
   - Technology stack decisions (frontend framework, backend framework, state management)
   - Data flow and communication patterns
   - Security: API keys MUST be stored server-side only, never in the frontend. Backend is required to proxy OpenAI API calls.
   - Component hierarchy and responsibilities
   - API integration strategy (frontend → backend → OpenAI)

2. **IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY.md** - A concise implementation strategy that includes:
   - Phased approach to building the chatbot
   - Step-by-step implementation plan
   - Dependencies and packages to install (frontend and backend)
   - Key features to implement (chat interface, message history, loading states, error handling)
   - Testing strategy
   - Environment setup requirements

3. **IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md** - A progress tracking document with:
   - Checklist of implementation tasks
   - Status tracking (not started, in progress, completed)
   - Notes section for each task
   - This should be initialized with all planned tasks from the implementation strategy

4. **README.md** - Update the existing README.md to include:
   - Project description for the OpenAI chatbot
   - Setup instructions including environment variable configuration
   - API key setup instructions (backend only)
   - Development workflow
   - Usage instructions
   - Project structure overview

5. **.cursorrules** - Create a Cursor IDE rules file that includes:
   - Project-specific coding standards and conventions
   - React/TypeScript best practices for this project
   - Guidelines for component structure and naming
   - API integration patterns to follow
   - Code organization principles

Please ensure all documents are terse, well-structured, and provide clear guidance for the implementation phase. The architecture should be practical and suitable for a simple but production-ready chatbot interface.


=== PROMPT 2: Chatbot Implementation ===

Now that we have the architecture and implementation strategy in place, please implement the OpenAI-based chatbot with a web interface according to the specifications in ARCHITECTURE.md and IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY.md.

**CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENT**: API keys must NEVER be stored in the frontend. You must create a backend server that handles all OpenAI API calls. The frontend should only communicate with your backend API.

Key requirements:
- Create a clean, modern chat interface with React and TypeScript (frontend)
- Create a backend server to proxy OpenAI API calls (API keys stored server-side only)
- Integrate with OpenAI API via backend (using the chat completions endpoint)
- Implement message history and conversation management
- Add proper loading states and error handling
- Make the UI responsive and user-friendly
- Follow the coding standards defined in .cursorrules

Please:
1. Install all necessary dependencies (frontend and backend)
2. Create the backend API server with OpenAI integration
3. Create the required frontend components and utilities
4. Set up environment variable configuration (backend only for API keys)
5. Implement the chat functionality with proper frontend-backend communication
6. Add proper TypeScript types
7. Update IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md as you complete each task
8. Ensure the code is well-commented and follows best practices

The chatbot should be fully functional and ready for use once implementation is complete.
