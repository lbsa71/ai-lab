=== PROMPT 1: AI Scaffolding Preparation ===

Please help establish the foundational scaffolding for building a simple OpenAI-based chatbot with a web interface. I need you to create the following documentation and configuration files:

1. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - A comprehensive architecture document that outlines:
   - System architecture and component structure
   - Technology stack decisions (frontend framework, state management, API integration approach)
   - Data flow and communication patterns
   - Security considerations (API key handling, CORS, etc.)
   - Component hierarchy and responsibilities
   - API integration strategy with OpenAI

2. **IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY.md** - A detailed implementation strategy that includes:
   - Phased approach to building the chatbot
   - Step-by-step implementation plan
   - Dependencies and packages to install
   - Key features to implement (chat interface, message history, loading states, error handling)
   - Testing strategy
   - Environment setup requirements

3. **IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md** - A progress tracking document with:
   - Checklist of implementation tasks
   - Status tracking (not started, in progress, completed)
   - Notes section for each task
   - This should be initialized with all planned tasks from the implementation strategy

4. **README.md** - Update the existing README.md to include:
   - Project description for the OpenAI chatbot
   - Setup instructions including environment variable configuration
   - API key setup instructions
   - Development workflow
   - Usage instructions
   - Project structure overview

5. **.cursorrules** - Create a Cursor IDE rules file that includes:
   - Project-specific coding standards and conventions
   - React/TypeScript best practices for this project
   - Guidelines for component structure and naming
   - API integration patterns to follow
   - Code organization principles

Please ensure all documents are comprehensive, well-structured, and provide clear guidance for the implementation phase. The architecture should be practical and suitable for a simple but production-ready chatbot interface.


=== PROMPT 2: Chatbot Implementation ===

Now that we have the architecture and implementation strategy in place, please implement the OpenAI-based chatbot with a web interface according to the specifications in ARCHITECTURE.md and IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY.md.

Key requirements:
- Create a clean, modern chat interface with React and TypeScript
- Integrate with OpenAI API (using the chat completions endpoint)
- Implement message history and conversation management
- Add proper loading states and error handling
- Ensure secure API key handling (use environment variables)
- Make the UI responsive and user-friendly
- Follow the coding standards defined in .cursorrules

Please:
1. Install all necessary dependencies
2. Create the required components and utilities
3. Set up environment variable configuration
4. Implement the chat functionality with OpenAI integration
5. Add proper TypeScript types
6. Update IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md as you complete each task
7. Ensure the code is well-commented and follows best practices

The chatbot should be fully functional and ready for use once implementation is complete.
