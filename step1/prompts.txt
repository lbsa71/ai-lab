Hi! I want to create a simpe chat client for the openai API.
There should be a chat interface with a text input and a send button.
When the user clicks the send button, the text should be sent to the openai API 
and the response should be displayed in the chat interface.

Before this, can you update the .windsurfrules file that I started on?

I want us to add that we should always keep the README.md file up to date, and track progress in a tasks.md file.

Also add any other instructions you think are relevant to code a quick demo like this.
